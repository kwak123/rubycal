# rubycal
Ruby for all!

### TODO (for me)
* Improve calendar tests for update/delete
* Start using params in console handlers
* Add tests for get_events in RubyCal::App
* Add some way of seeing all events with dates attached
* ~~Add tests for street_address into Location~~ _should actually be UI tests_
