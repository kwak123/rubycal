# rubycal
Ruby for all!

### Getting started
* Using rake to run the app<br>
  ```rake```

* Using rake to run the tests<br>
  ```rake test```

* Using rake to run tests and generate coverage report<br>
  ```rake coverage```

* Using rake to view coverage report</br>
  ```rake view```
  
* Using the Gemfile to run the app<br>
  ```bundle exec ruby app.rb```

* Using the Gemfile to run the tests<br>
  ```bundle exec ruby -Ilib:test test.rb -v```

### TODO (for me)
* ~~Add some way of seeing all events with dates attached~~ Determine usefulness first
* ~~Add tests for street_address into Location~~ _should actually be UI tests_
